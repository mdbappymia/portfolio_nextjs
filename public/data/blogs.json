    "description": "<p>In the modern technology world, CSS is the most important thing. In the web technology world, to show a webpage to the browser we used HTML code. The HTML code structure is very ugly and it looks like a skeleton of the human body without muscle. It is the only structure of the webpage. To design a colorful and give the beauty of the website, we used CSS. The CSS code can be designed the HTML code. It gives the muscle of the skeleton. CSS plays an important role in the web development technology world. There are several versions of CSS. The CSS3 is the most useable version. It allows animation, transition, and any other extra features.\n</p>\n<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to the HTML page. There are several rules to use CSS. Such as inline CSS, which is used inside the HTML element using the style attribute. Internal CSS that is used inside the head tag using style tag. External CSS are use external CSS files that are linked to the HTML file inside the head tag. Here are some examples:\n</p>\n<img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/storage/media/images/8c4493d3-110c-4a95-8b70-7626ce2d2f4e.o.jpg\" alt=\"CSS code\" />\n<h4>CSS specificity </h4>\n<p>To style an HTML component, you need to select the component. There are several rules to select the HTML element. You can use tag name, id, class to select the HTML element. If there are two or more conflicting CSS rules that point to the same element, the browser follows some rules to determine which one is most specific and therefore wins out. That's is called CSS specificity. The CSS specificity hierarchy is:\ninline>id>tagname,class>pseudo element.\n</p>\n<h4>Box model</h4>\n<p>There are many properties that are used to style the HTML element. The box model is the most important thing in CSS. \nThe box model is one of the important parts of CSS. In the CSS, all HTML elements are realized that a box. There are several parts of the box model. Such as,\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Content</li>\n<li>Padding</li>\n<li>Margin</li>\n<li>Border</li>\n</ul>\n<img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/725/1*FqGQIGmGdW5EetfS3HFkvA.png\" alt=\"box model\" />\n<p>To style a element you should follow the box model rule.\n</p>\n",

    "img": "https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/1*AoOWn4UdPyuixXtkLQsQXA.png",
    "short_desc": "An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.",
    "description": "<p>In the javascript programming language, the array is a single variable that is used to store some different elements. It is used when we want to store a number of list elements in a variable. Most of the programming languages, arrays reference multiple variables. But javascript array is a single variable that stores multiple elements. </p>\n<p>Example: \n<br >\nconst arr = [“rahim”,”karim”,abdullah”,”kolim”]\n<br>\n</p>\n<p>This is an example of a javascript array. To access an element of the array, you need to the index number of the element. Suppose we need to the element where this index is 2. We can write </p>\n\n<p>Const element2 = arr[2]\n<br>\nNote: The array index starts always at 0.\n<br>\nYou can declare a specific index element in the array. Like as:\n<br>\narr[3] = “momin”\n<br>\nThe array will be : [“rahim”,”karim”,abdullah”,”momin”]\n</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Methods of array</h3>\n<br>\n<p>There are several methods are offer javascript array. Some methods are discussed below:\n<br>\n<h4>Concat</h4>\n<br>\nThe concat method is used to add two arrays. \n<br>\nExample :<br>\nconst arr1 = [1,2,3,4]<br>\nconst arr2=[5,6,7]<br>\nconst arr3 = arr1.concat(arr2)<br>\nconsole.log(arr3)<br>\n\nResult = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] </p>\n<br>\n<h4>Find</h4>\n<p>The find method is another important method in javascript. In an array you need to find a specific element with the base of the condition, you can find this easily using the find method which provides javascript. \n<br>\nExample:\n<br>\nconst arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] \n<br>\nconst findTwo = arr.find(item=>item===”2”)\n<br>\nIt will return true.\n</p>\n<h4>Filter</h4>\n<br>\n<p>Another important method is filter. To filter an array based on the specific condition, you need to the filter method. \n<br>\nExample: <br>\nSuppose you need to filter the even element in the array.<br>\n\nconst arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] <br>\nconst evenArray = arr.filter(item=>item%2=0)<br>\nconsole.log(evenArray)<br>\n\nResult: [2,4,6]<br>\n</p>\n<h4>Map </h4>\n<br>\n<p>The most interesting method is the map method. You can easily traverse an array using the map method. You can do specific work based on the array using the map method. It returns a new array.\n<br>\nThere is more metho that occurs in javascript. Such as push, pop, unshift, forEach, etc. This method uses some special purpose.\n</p>\n<h3>Here is an example some method</h3>\n<img style=\"width:90%; margin:auto; height:400px\" src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/HqQBmiiyTtEqo1YzyeBd6iS-iPPuYYctW4wvQHP8W1E.jpg?auto=webp&s=23bf1622c3ec703003de590a6c92cc9748554fe6\" alt=\"array\" />",

It also contains the terms of this data exchange.</p>\n<img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://www.altexsoft.com/media/2019/06/Screenshot_1.png\" />\n<h4>Types of APIs</h4>\n<p>There are several types of API. In terms of release policies, APIs can be a private, partner, or public.</p>\n<br>\n<p><b>Privet API:</b> This API mostly used an organization or a company. Its API apps are mostly built for a company employee. It cannot access other public outside the company employee. \n<br>\n<b>Partner API:</b> In this partner API, It mostly used to share two companies or two partners. The common use case for partner APIs is software integration between two parties.\n\n<b>Public API:</b> It is known as developer-facing or external, these APIs are available for any third-party developers. It allows all users that can access all users.</p>\n<br>\n<h4>The use cases of API</h4>\n<br><p>\nThere are several use cases of API.</p>\n<br>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Database API:</b> It enables communication of the database and access, change, delete and put data to the database using queries.</li>\n<li><b>Web API</b></li>\n<li><b>Operating systems APIs</b></li>\n<li><b>Remote APIs</b></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<h3>What is rest API?</h3>\n<br>\n<p>\nThe web APIs that comply with REST architectural constraints are called RESTful APIs. It uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating, and deleting (CRUD) of operations concerning resources.\n <br>\n<ul>\n<li>GET  used to receive data;</li>\n<li>PUT to change the state of or update a resource, which can be an object, file, or block;</li>\n<li>POST to create that resource;</li>\n<li>DELETE to remove the data.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:center\">JavaScript this keyword</h2>\n<p>The “this” keyword is one of the most widely used and yet confusing keywords in JavaScript. Here, you'll learn everything about this keyword. The “this” keyword points to a particular object. Now, which is that object depends on how a function that incorporates the 'this' keyword is being called. You can create an object of a function using new keyword. So, when you create an object of a function using new keyword then this keyword will point to that particular object.

    "description": "<br>\n<p>The react js is a lightweight component-based javascript library. It is a front-end library to design a dynamic webpage. It is easy to use and learn. It is a component-based library, so a webpage divided can be separated easily by a number of components. It is easy to manage and debug the webpage. Created single page application, react js is used. There are many advantages to react js. But it some little able disadvantage. React used one-way data binding. The child component access the parent data using props. But it can not send data to the parent component. In javascript, work on the real dom of the browser. But react js work on the virtual dom. Virtual dom like as a copy of real dom. When we change a single element, the real dom re-render all the elements. So the webpage will be slow. But the virtual dom can only change the element where change and another element will be unchanged. It searches the change element used on the diff algorithm. So react js if first.</p>\n<br>\n<h4>React components</h4>\n<p>React has two types of component use. Class component and functional component. When we need to manage the state of this component, we use the class component. So that we say, the class component is a stateful component and the functional component is a stateless component. A class component is like a javascript es6 class that is inherent in the react component. It has a render method that returns a JSX element. A functional component like as javascript function. It returns directly the JSX element. Note that: a component cannot return multiple JSX elements.</p>\n<br>\n<h4>JSX</h4>\n<p>JSX stands for javascript XML. It is like HTML but it is not directly HTML. It is really javascript code but it looks like HTML. It is called syntactic sugar of react js. It used especially react js. </p>\n<br>\n<img style=\"width:100%;height:500px\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*_gXwacfA-wFIW-F65J7eAw.png\" />\n<br>\n<h4>State and props in React js</h4>\n<p>A state is a javascript object that represents the information of the component. It is used to store the component information as the property of the state. When the state changed, the component will be re-render and it updates the new value. The props are used to send data from parent component to child component. When we need to pass data from the parent component, it passes by using props. The props are read-only. The child component cannot change the value of props. </p>\n<br>\n<h4>Hooks</h4>\n<p>Hooks is a special function of react. It is like a javascript function used especially react. There are several types of hook has in react js. Such as,\nuseState, useEffect, useMemo, useReducer, useRef etc. The react functional component cannot do some special work that is done in-class components. But hooks it can easily to done special work which done buy class component it works on functional component. In the functional component, we could not manage the state. But the useState hooks can easily manage the state in the functional components. The useEffect hooks can handle the side effect of the react component. Hook make it easier to use the react.\n</p>",

    "description": "<br>\n<p>In the computer programming language, CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete. These four basic functions of persistent storage. Also, each letter in the acronym can refer to all functions executed in relational or non-relation database applications like SQL and no-SQL databases. It also can describe user-interface conventions that allow viewing, searching, and modifying information through computer-based forms and reports. In essence, entities are read, created, updated, and deleted. those self-same entities are often modified by taking the info from a service and changing the setting properties before sending the info back to the service for an update. Plus, CRUD is data-oriented and therefore the standardized use of HTTP action verbs.\n</p>\n<h4>This is what each operation does:</h4>\n<br>\n<li>Create (POST) - Make something</li>\n<li>Read (GET)- Get something</li>\n<li>Update (PUT) - Change something</li>\n<li>Delete (DELETE)- Remove something</li>\n<br>\n<p>\nIf we put CRUD, Express, and MongoDB together into a single diagram, this is what it would look like:\n</p>\n<img style=\"width:80%\" src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*2eBdh0vLZjUyCDF6x1EqvQ.png\" />\n<br>\n<h4>Node JS</h4>\n<br>\n<p>NodeJs is an asynchronous event-driven javascript runtime by which we can now run javascript outside the browser. It is made by javascript and c++ code based on chromes V8 engine. Now, what is the javascript runtime here? Javascript runtime is like a container or an environment where our written javascript code gets executed. If can be compared with the chrome browser this is the place where we used to execute our js code before the arrival of node Js. In the early days, we didn’t have the power to execute the js code outside of a browser but now we can run js code outside of a browser with the help of node Js.</p>\n<br>\n<h4>Express JS</h4>\n<br>\n<p>ExpressJs is a node js framework for backend web applications. It provides us with a group of features that are wont to manage the backend of internet sites and web applications and also for mobile applications. we will also build APIs with the assistance of nodeJs and Express Js.\n</p>\n",
